-weapons: 

notes:
GM means only one of us the people like Wing, Jung, David, Lizer and Clifford can have these weapons and its one of a kind so you guys make one.
speed swing: how fast the weapon can be swung by ninja: 100% is the max and impossible for a player to have
Attack: the damage the weapon has 100 is the most damage the game will allow. 
crit chance: the chance of a crit to happen. The higher the percentage is the chance of a crit happening 
(note 100% does not = 100% crit always need to find a good math equation for this and crit attack is always double the attack damage you do)
the () next to the weapon is where the weapon can be be bought or found.
The quotes next to the weapon is the weapon info of that weapon.
